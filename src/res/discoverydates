29	Copper	9000 BC	6000 BC	Middle East	Anatolia	Copper was probably the first metal mined and crafted by humans.[1] It was originally obtained as a native metal and later from the smelting of ores. Earliest estimates of the discovery of copper suggest around 9000 BC in the Middle East. It was one of the most important materials to humans throughout the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages. Copper beads dating from 6000 BC have been found in Çatal Höyük, Anatolia[2] and the archaeological site of Belovode on the Rudnik mountain in Serbia contains the world's oldest securely dated evidence of copper smelting from 5000 BC.[3][4]
82	Lead	7000 BC	3800 BC	Africa	Abydos, Egypt	It is believed that lead smelting began at least 9,000 years ago, and the oldest known artifact of lead is a statuette found at the temple of Osiris on the site of Abydos dated around 3800 BC.[5]
79	Gold	before-6000 BC	Before 4000 BC	Levant	Wadi Qana	The earliest gold artifacts were discovered at the site of Wadi Qana in the Levant.[6]
47	Silver	before-5000 BC	ca. 4000 BC	Asia Minor	Asia Minor	Estimated to have been discovered in Asia Minor shortly after copper and gold.[7][8]
26	Iron	before-5000 BC	4000 BC	Middle East	Egypt	There is evidence that iron was known from before 5000 BC.[9] The oldest known iron objects used by humans are some beads of meteoric iron, made in Egypt in about 4000 BC. The discovery of smelting around 3000 BC led to the start of the Iron Age around 1200 BC[10] and the prominent use of iron for tools and weapons.[11]
6	Carbon	3750 BC	2500 BC	Egyptians and Sumerians	Middle East	The earliest known use of charcoal was for the reduction of copper, zinc, and tin ores in the manufacture of bronze, by the Egyptians and Sumerians.[12] Diamonds were probably known as early as 2500 BC.[13] True chemical analyses were made in the 18th century,[14] and in 1789 carbon was listed by Antoine Lavoisier as an element.[15]
50	Tin	3500 BC	2000 BC	Asia Minor	Kestel	First smelted in combination with copper around 3500 BC to produce bronze (and thus giving place to the Bronze Age in those places where Iron Age did not intrude directly on Neolithic of the Stone Age).[clarification needed][16] Kestel, in southern Turkey, is the site of an ancient Cassiterite mine that was used from 3250 to 1800 BC.[17] The oldest artifacts date from around 2000 BC.[18]
16	Sulfur	before-2000 BC	Before AD 815	Middle East	Middle East	First used at least 4,000 years ago.[19] According to the Ebers Papyrus, a sulfur ointment was used in ancient Egypt to treat granular eyelids.[20] Recognized as an element by Jabir ibn Hayyan before AD 815,[21] and by Antoine Lavoisier in 1777.
80	Mercury	1500 BC	1500 BC	Egyptians	Egypt	Found in Egyptian tombs dating from 1500 BC.[22]
30	Zinc	before-1000 BC	1000 BC	Indian metallurgists	Indian subcontinent	Used as a component of brass since antiquity (before 1000 BC) by Indian metallurgists, but its true nature was not understood in ancient times. Identified as a distinct metal in the Rasaratna Samuccaya around the 14th century of the Christian era[23] and by the alchemist Paracelsus in 1526.[24] Isolated by Andreas Sigismund Marggraf in 1746.[25]
33	Arsenic	before-AD 815	Before AD 815	Middle-Eastern alchemists	Middle East	The use of metallic arsenic was described by the Egyptian alchemist Zosimos.[26] The purification of arsenic was later described by Persian alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan.[27] Albertus Magnus (c. 1200-1280) is typically credited with the description of the metalloid in the West.[28]
51	Antimony	before-AD 815	Before AD 815	Jabir ibn Hayyan	Middle East	Dioscorides and Pliny both describe the accidental production of metallic antimony from stibnite, but only seem to recognize the metal as lead.[29] The intentional isolation of antimony is described by Persian alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan.[27] In Europe, the metal was being produced and used by 1540, when it was described by Vannoccio Biringuccio.[30]
83	Bismuth	before-AD 1000	Before AD 1000	Jabirian corpus	Middle East	Described by Persian alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan in the Jabirian corpus.[31][32] Later described in Europe by Claude François Geoffroy in 1753.[33]

78	Platinum	1735	A. de Ulloa			First description of a metal found in South American gold was in 1557 by Julius Caesar Scaliger. Ulloa published his findings in 1748, but Sir Charles Wood also investigated the metal in 1741. First reference to it as a new metal was made by William Brownrigg in 1750.[36]
28	Nickel	1751	F. Cronstedt	1751	F. Cronstedt	Found by attempting to extract copper from the mineral known as fake copper (now known as niccolite).[37]
12	Magnesium	1755	J. Black	1808	H. Davy	Black observed that magnesia alba (MgO) was not quicklime (CaO). Davy isolated the metal electrochemically from magnesia.[38]
1	Hydrogen	1766	H. Cavendish	ca. 1500	Paracelsus	Cavendish was the first to distinguish H
8	Oxygen	1771	W. Scheele	1604	Sendivogius	Obtained it by heating mercuric oxide and nitrates in 1771, but did not publish his findings until 1777. Joseph Priestley also prepared this new air by 1774, but only Lavoisier recognized it as a true element; he named it in 1777.[41][42] Before him, Sendivogius had produced oxygen by heating saltpetre, correctly identifying it as the "food of life".[43]
7	Nitrogen	1772	D. Rutherford	1772	D. Rutherford	He discovered nitrogen while he was studying at the University of Edinburgh.[44] He showed that the air in which animals had breathed, even after removal of the exhaled carbon dioxide, was no longer able to burn a candle. Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley also studied the element at about the same time, and Lavoisier named it in 1775-6.[45]
56	Barium	1772	W. Scheele	1808	H. Davy	Scheele distinguished a new earth (BaO) in pyrolusite and Davy isolated the metal by electrolysis.[46]
17	Chlorine	1774	W. Scheele	1774	W. Scheele	Obtained it from hydrochloric acid, but thought it was an oxide. Only in 1808 did Humphry Davy recognize it as an element.[47]
25	Manganese	1774	W. Scheele	1774	G. Gahn	Distinguished pyrolusite as the calx of a new metal. Ignatius Gottfred Kaim also discovered the new metal in 1770, as did Scheele in 1774. It was isolated by reduction of manganese dioxide with carbon.[48]

92	Uranium	1789	H. Klaproth	1841	E.-M. Péligot	Klaproth mistakenly identified a uranium oxide obtained from pitchblende as the element itself and named it after the recently discovered planet Uranus.[56][57]
22	Titanium	1791	W. Gregor	1825	J. Berzelius	Gregor found an oxide of a new metal in ilmenite; Klaproth independently discovered the element in rutile in 1795 and named it. The pure metallic form was only obtained in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter.[58][59]
39	Yttrium	1794	J. Gadolin	1843	H. Rose	Discovered in gadolinite, but Mosander showed later that its ore, yttria, contained more elements.[60][61] Wöhler mistakenly thought he had isolated the metal in 1828 from a volatile chloride he supposed to be yttrium chloride,[62][63] but Rose proved otherwise in 1843 and correctly isolated the element himself that year.
24	Chromium	1794	N. Vauquelin	1797	N. Vauquelin	Vauquelin discovered the trioxide in crocoite ore, and later isolated the metal by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven.[64][65]
4	Beryllium	1798	N. Vauquelin	1828	F. Wöhler and A. Bussy	Vauquelin discovered the oxide in beryl and emerald, and Klaproth suggested the present name around 1808.[66]
23	Vanadium	1801	M. del Río	1830	N.G.Sefström	Río found the metal in vanadinite but retracted the claim after Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils disputed it. Sefström isolated and named it, and later it was shown that Río had been right in the first place.[67]
41	Niobium	1801	C. Hatchett	1864	W. Blomstrand	Hatchett found the element in columbite ore and named it columbium. Heinrich Rose proved in 1844 that the element is distinct from tantalum, and renamed it niobium which was officially accepted in 1949.[68]
73	Tantalum	1802	G. Ekeberg			Ekeberg found another element in minerals similar to columbite and in 1844, Heinrich Rose proved that it was distinct from niobium.[69]
46	Palladium	1802	W. H. Wollaston	1802	W. H. Wollaston	Wollaston discovered it in samples of platinum from South America, but did not publish his results immediately. He had intended to name it after the newly discovered asteroid, Ceres, but by the time he published his results in 1804, cerium had taken that name. Wollaston named it after the more recently discovered asteroid Pallas.[70]
58	Cerium	1803	H. Klaproth, J. Berzelius, and W. Hisinger	1838	G. Mosander	Berzelius and Hisinger discovered the element in ceria and named it after the newly discovered asteroid (then considered a planet), Ceres. Klaproth discovered it simultaneously and independently in some tantalum samples. Mosander proved later that the samples of all three researchers had at least another element in them, lanthanum.[71]
76	Osmium	1803	S. Tennant	1803	S. Tennant	Tennant had been working on samples of South American platinum in parallel with Wollaston and discovered two new elements, which he named osmium and iridium.[72]
77	Iridium	1803	S. Tennant	1803	S. Tennant	Tennant had been working on samples of South American platinum in parallel with Wollaston and discovered two new elements, which he named osmium and iridium, and published the iridium results in 1804.[73]
45	Rhodium	1804	H. Wollaston	1804	H. Wollaston	Wollaston discovered and isolated it from crude platinum samples from South America.[74]

20	Calcium	1808	H. Davy	1808	H. Davy	Davy discovered the metal by electrolysis of quicklime.[76]
5	Boron	1808	L. Gay-Lussac and L.J. Thénard	1808	H. Davy	Radical boracique appears on the list of elements in Lavoisier's Traité Élémentaire de Chimie from 1789.[53] On June 21, 1808, Lussac and Thénard announced a new element in sedative salt, Davy announced the isolation of a new substance from boracic acid on June 30.[77]
9	Fluorine	1810	A.-M. Ampère	1886	H. Moissan	Radical fluorique appears on the list of elements in Lavoisier's Traité Élémentaire de Chimie from 1789, but radical muriatique also appears instead of chlorine.[53] André-Marie Ampère predicted an element analogous to chlorine obtainable from hydrofluoric acid, and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain this element. It was eventually isolated by Moissan.[78]
53	Iodine	1811	B. Courtois	1811	B. Courtois	Courtois discovered it in the ashes of seaweed.[79]
3	Lithium	1817	A. Arfwedson	1821	W. T. Brande	Arfwedson discovered the alkali in petalite.[80]
48	Cadmium	1817	S. L Hermann, F. Stromeyer, and J.C.H. Roloff	1817	S. L Hermann, F. Stromeyer, and J.C.H. Roloff	All three found an unknown metal in a sample of zinc oxide from Silesia, but the name that Stromeyer gave became the accepted one.[81]
34	Selenium	1817	J. Berzelius and G. Gahn	1817	J. Berzelius and G. Gahn	While working with lead they discovered a substance that they thought was tellurium, but realized after more investigation that it was different.[82]
14	Silicon	1823	J. Berzelius	1823	J. Berzelius	Humphry Davy thought in 1800 that silica was a compound, not an element, and in 1808 suggested the present name. In 1811 Louis-Joseph Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Thénard probably prepared impure silicon,[83] but Berzelius is credited with the discovery for obtaining the pure element in 1823.[84]
13	Aluminium	1825	H.C.Ørsted	1825	H.C.Ørsted	Antoine Lavoisier predicted in 1787 that alumina is the oxide of an undiscovered element, and in 1808 Humphry Davy tried to decompose it. Although he failed, he suggested the present name. Hans Christian Ørsted was the first to isolate metallic aluminium in 1825.[85]
35	Bromine	1825	J. Balard and C. Löwig	1825	J. Balard and C. Löwig	They both discovered the element in the autumn of 1825. Balard published his results the next year,[86] but Löwig did not publish until 1827.[87]
90	Thorium	1829	J. Berzelius	1914	D. Lely, Jr. and L. Hamburger	Berzelius obtained the oxide of a new earth in thorite.[88]
57	Lanthanum	1838	G. Mosander	1841	G. Mosander	Mosander found a new element in samples of ceria and published his results in 1842, but later he showed that this lanthana contained four more elements.[89]

65	Terbium	1843	G. Mosander	1886	J.C.G. de Marignac	Mosander managed to split the old yttria into yttria proper and erbia, and later terbia too.[91]
44	Ruthenium	1844	K. Claus	1844	K. Claus	Gottfried Wilhelm Osann thought that he found three new metals in Russian platinum samples, and in 1844 Karl Karlovich Klaus confirmed that there was a new element.[92]
55	Caesium	1860	R. Bunsen and R. Kirchhoff	1882	C. Setterberg	Bunsen and Kirchhoff were the first to suggest finding new elements by spectrum analysis. They discovered caesium by its two blue emission lines in a sample of Dürkheim mineral water.[93] The pure metal was eventually isolated in 1882 by Setterberg.[94]
37	Rubidium	1861	R. Bunsen and G. R. Kirchhoff		Hevesy	Bunsen and Kirchhoff discovered it just a few months after caesium, by observing new spectral lines in the mineral lepidolite. Bunsen never obtained a pure sample of the metal, which was later obtained by Hevesy.[95]
81	Thallium	1861	W. Crookes	1862	C.-A. Lamy	Shortly after the discovery of rubidium, Crookes found a new green line in a selenium sample; later that year, Lamy found the element to be metallic.[96]
49	Indium	1863	F. Reich and T. Richter	1867	T. Richter	Reich and Richter First identified it in sphalerite by its bright indigo-blue spectroscopic emission line. Richter isolated the metal several years later.[97]
2	Helium	1868	P. Janssen and N. Lockyer	1895	W. Ramsay, T. Cleve, and N. Langlet	Janssen and Lockyer observed independently a yellow line in the solar spectrum that did not match any other element. This was the first observation of a noble gas, located in the Sun. Years later after the isolation of argon on Earth, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet observed independently helium trapped in cleveite.[98]
31	Gallium	1875	P. E. L. de Boisbaudran	4	P. E. L. de Boisbaudran	Boisbaudran observed on a pyrenea blende sample some emission lines corresponding to the eka-aluminium that was predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 and subsequently isolated the element by electrolysis.[99][100]
70	Ytterbium	1878	J.C.G. de Marignac	1906	C. A. von Welsbach	On October 22, 1878, Marignac reported splitting terbia into two new earths, terbia proper and ytterbia.[101]
67	Holmium	1878	J.-L. Soret and M. Delafontaine	1879	T. Cleve	Soret found it in samarskite and later, Per Teodor Cleve split Marignac's erbia into erbia proper and two new elements, thulium and holmium. Delafontaine's philippium turned out to be identical to what Soret found.[102][103]

62	Samarium	1879	P.E.L. de Boisbaudran	1879	P.E.L. de Boisbaudran	Boisbaudran noted a new earth in samarskite and named it samaria after the mineral.[106]
64	Gadolinium	1880	J. C. G. de Marignac	1886	P.E.L. de Boisbaudran	Marignac initially observed the new earth in terbia, and later Boisbaudran obtained a pure sample from samarskite.[107]
59	Praseodymium	1885	C. A. von Welsbach 4			Carl Auer von Welsbach discovered two new distinct elements in Mosander's didymia: praseodymium and neodymium.[108]
60	Neodymium	1885	C. A. von Welsbach 4			Carl Auer von Welsbach discovered two new distinct elements in Mosander's didymia: praseodymium and neodymium.[109]

66	Dysprosium	1886	P.E.L. de Boisbaudran	4		De Boisbaudran found a new earth in erbia.[111]
18	Argon	1894	Lord Rayleigh and W. Ramsay	1894	Lord Rayleigh and W. Ramsay	They discovered the gas by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by liquefaction from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means. It is the first noble gas to be isolated.[112]
63	Europium	1896	E.-A. Demarçay	1901	E.-A. Demarçay	Demarçay found spectral lines of a new element in Lecoq's samarium, and separated this element several years later.[113]
36	Krypton	1898	W. Ramsay and W. Travers	1898	W. Ramsay and W. Travers	On May 30, 1898, Ramsay separated a noble gas from liquid argon by difference in boiling point.[114]
10	Neon	1898	W. Ramsay and W. Travers	1898	W. Ramsay and W. Travers	In June 1898 Ramsay separated a new noble gas from liquid argon by difference in boiling point.[114]
54	Xenon	1898	W. Ramsay and W. Travers	1898	W. Ramsay and W. Travers	On July 12, 1898 Ramsay separated a third noble gas within three weeks, from liquid argon by difference in boiling point.[115]
84	Polonium	1898	P. and M. Curie	1902	W. Marckwald	In an experiment done on July 13, 1898, the Curies noted an increased radioactivity in the uranium obtained from pitchblende, which they ascribed to an unknown element.[116]
88	Radium	1898	P. and M. Curie	1902	M. Curie	The Curies reported on December 26, 1898, a new element different from polonium, which Marie later isolated from uraninite.[117]
86	Radon	1899	E. Rutherford and R. B. Owens	1910	W. Ramsay and R. Whytlaw-Gray	Rutherford and Owens discovered a radioactive gas resulting from the radioactive decay of thorium, isolated later by Ramsay and Gray. In 1900, Friedrich Ernst Dorn discovered a longer-lived isotope of the same gas from the radioactive decay of radium. Since "radon" was first used to specifically designate Dorn's isotope before it became the name for the element, he is often mistakenly given credit for the latter instead of the former.[118][119]
89	Actinium	1902	F. O. Giesel	1902	F. O. Giesel	Giesel obtained from pitchblende a substance that had properties similar to those of lanthanum and named it emanium.[120] André-Louis Debierne had previously reported the discovery of a new element actinium that was supposedly similar to titanium and thorium; the elements were mistakenly identified as being identical and Debierne's name was chosen, even though in retrospect Debierne's substance could not have included much actual element 89.[121]
71	Lutetium	1906	C. A. von Welsbach and G. Urbain	1906	C. A. von Welsbach	von Welsbach proved that the old ytterbium also contained a new element, which he named cassiopeium. Urbain also proved this simultaneously, but his samples were very impure and only contained trace quantities of the new element. Despite this, his chosen name lutetium was adopted.[122]
75	Rhenium	1908	M. Ogawa	1919	M. Ogawa	Ogawa found it in thorianite but assigned it as element 43 instead of 75 and named it nipponium.[123] In 1925 Walter Noddack, Ida Eva Tacke and Otto Berg announced its separation from gadolinite and gave it the present name.[124]
91	Protactinium	1913	O. H. Göhring and K. Fajans	1927	A. von Grosse	The two obtained the first isotope of this element that had been predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 as a member of the natural decay of 238U.[125] Originally isolated in 1900 by William Crookes, who nevertheless did not recognize that it was a new element.[126]
72	Hafnium	1922	D. Coster and G. von Hevesy	1922	D. Coster and G. von Hevesy	Georges Urbain claimed to have found the element in rare-earth residues, while Vladimir Vernadsky independently found it in orthite. Neither claim was confirmed due to World War I, and neither could be confirmed later, as the chemistry they reported does not match that now known for hafnium. After the war, Coster and Hevesy found it by X-ray spectroscopic analysis in Norwegian zircon.[127] Hafnium was the last stable element to be discovered.[128]
43	Technetium	1937	C. Perrier and E. Segrè	1937	C. Perrier & E.Segrè	The two discovered a new element in a molybdenum sample that was used in a cyclotron, the first synthetic element to be discovered, though it was later found out that it does occur naturally in minuscule trace quantities. It had been predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 as eka-manganese.[129][130][131]
87	Francium	1939	M. Perey	4		Perey discovered it as a decay product of 227Ac.[132] Francium was the last element to be discovered in nature, rather than synthesized in the lab, although four of the "synthetic" elements that were discovered later (plutonium, neptunium, astatine, and promethium) were eventually found in trace amounts in nature as well.[133]
93	Neptunium	1940	E.M. McMillan and H. Abelson	4		Obtained by irradiating uranium with neutrons, it is the first transuranium element discovered.[134]
85	Astatine	1940	R. Corson, R. MacKenzie and E. Segrè	4		Obtained by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles.[135] Later determined to occur naturally in minuscule quantities (<25 grams in earth's crust).[136]
94	Plutonium	1940–1941	Glenn T. Seaborg, Arthur C. Wahl, W. Kennedy and E.M. McMillan	4		Prepared by bombardment of uranium with deuterons.[137]
61	Promethium	1942	S. Wu, E.G. Segrè and H. Bethe	1945	Charles D. Coryell, Jacob A. Marinsky, Lawrence E. Glendenin,[138][139] and Harold G. Richter[citation needed]	It was probably first prepared in 1942 by bombarding neodymium and praseodymium with neutrons, but separation of the element could not be carried out. Isolation was performed under the Manhattan Project in 1945.[140]
