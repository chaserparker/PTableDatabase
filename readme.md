This program allows users to quickly access a plethora of useful information pertaining to the periodic table. Along with housing basic info that is found on any periodic table (symbol, mass, atomic number), it also provides an element's half life, scientist(s) who discovered it, and electron configuration.

It also allows users to easily compute the mass of chemical compounds. This is especially useful for high school and collegiate-level chemistry classes, where many problems require finding the mass of compounds. This process is often arduous and time-consuming.

Perhaps more interestingly, this program includes a "Symbol Speller" that spells words using only element abbreviations. If a word can't be spelled (e.g. "Jill"), it will return the longest possible subsequence.
